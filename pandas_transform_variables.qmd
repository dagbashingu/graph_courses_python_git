import pandas as pd

```

# Dataset


```{python}
counties = pd.read_csv("Data/us_counties_data.csv")
counties
```


```{python}
area_df = counties [["county","area_sq_miles","pop_20"]]

area_df
```

# Creating new variables

```{python}
# New variable with area in sq kilometers
area_df ["area_sq_km"] = area_df["area_sq_miles"] * 2.59

area_df
```


```{python}
area_df ["area_sq_hectares"] = area_df ["area_sq_km"] * 100
area_df
```
# Practice Q: Area in Acres
```{python}
area_df ["area_acres"] = area_df ["area_sq_miles"] * 640
area_df
```

# Modifying existing columns
::: <!-- end columns -->

```{python}
area_df ["area_sq_km"] = area_df ["area_sq_km"].round(1)
area_df
```

```{python}
area_df ["area_acres"] = area_df ["area_acres"].round(1)
area_df
```

# Calculating with multiple variables


```{python}
area_df["pop_per_sq_km"] = (area_df["pop_20"]/area_df["area_sq_km"]).round(1)

area_df = area_df.sort_values (by = "pop_per_sq_km", ascending = False )
area_df
```

# Practice Q: Foreign born percentage


```{python}
counties["percent_foreign_born"] = (((counties["foreign_born_num"])/(counties["pop_20"]))*100).round(1)

counties = counties.sort_values (by = "percent_foreign_born", ascending = False)
counties
```

The top 2 counties with the highest percentage of foreign born residents are Miami-Dade, FL (53.9%) and Queens, NY (46.9%)

# Creating boolean variables


```{python}

```{python}
changes_df["pop_increase"] = changes_df["pop_change_2010_2020"] > 0
changes_df["emp_increase"] = changes_df["pct_emp_change_2010_2021"] > 0
changes_df
```


```{python}
# Counties where there is an increase inpopulation but not the case with employment
changes_df.query("pop_increase == True & emp_increase == False")
```

# Or 


```{python}
changes_df.query("pop_increase  & ~ (emp_increase)")
```

# Practice Q: Categorize counties by foreign-born population


```{python}
